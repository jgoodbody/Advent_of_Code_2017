# Advent of Code 2017

Welcome to my collection of loopy Python solutions to the daily puzzles in this festive programming challenge. Considering much of my experience with Python (and coding in general) has revolved around databases and data analysis, I figured this month-long exercise would let me learn some typical computer science problem solving. 

I'm working through all of these problems in a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). I was first exposed to this application through Coursera, where an entire [Python Data Science specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) used them for creating and grading assignments. It's a nice enviroment to code and debug piecemeal when you barely know what you're doing. I'm only making these standalone python scripts afterward in order to share my code here.
