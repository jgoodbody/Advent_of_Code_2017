# Advent of Code 2017

Welcome to my collection of loopy Python solutions to the daily puzzles in this festive programming challenge. Considering much of my experience with Python (and coding in general) has been based about databases, I figured this month-long exercise would let me learn some typical computer science problem solving. 

Thanks to [Ruhee](https://github.com/ruhee) for bringing this series to my attention.
